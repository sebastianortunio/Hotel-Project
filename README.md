This project is about a hotel business that requires a data analyst service to understand their data and get to know business requirements from the company. The owners of this busines want to know three specific insights:

- Is the hotel revenue growing by year?
- Should the hotel increase the parking lot?
- What trends does the data present on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonability?

  For this project I used SSMS to do some data exploration and Power BI to make an easy understandable dashboard for the hotel owners.

### Data Overview:

- Analyzing the data we can observe that the revenue for both hotels increased in 2019 but had a significant drop in 2020.
- In 2020 the world experienced the COVID-19 Pademic, which can be a factor of why the revenue from both hotels drop down that year.
- City Hotel generates more revenue than Resort Hotel in 2019 and 2020.
- Resort Hotel has a higher revenue in 2018.
- In 2019, City Hotel generated a significant growing revenue of $8,991,311.54.
